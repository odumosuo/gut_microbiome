# Exploration of Species Composition of Gut Microbiomes in Healthy Patients

## Description
The goal of this project is to determine what genera are unique to the distal lumen, unique to the
proximal mucosa, and shared between the two colon areas.

The data presented here was generated by amplifying and sequencing DNA from the V4 16S ribosomal subunit of two samples
which were collected from the colon microbiomes of healthy patients. This ribosomal locus is commonly
sequenced because it is well-conserved within bacterial species while also containing enough nucleotide
diversity to distinguish different genera. The files DL_1.txt and PM_1.txt contain the DNA sequences
sourced from healthy individualsâ€™ distal lumen and proximal mucosa respectively. The reference.fasta
file provided contains the V4 16S ribosomal subunit sequences of various bacterial genera.
